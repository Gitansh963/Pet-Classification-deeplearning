# Deep Learning Project: Oxford Pet Classification

This project focuses on the classification of pets using the Oxford Pet dataset. The project includes experiments with supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and state-of-the-art models. The project is divided into four Jupyter notebooks, each focusing on a different aspect of the project.

## Notebooks

1. **Data Preprocessing**: This notebook contains all the preprocessing steps required for the Oxford Pet dataset. It includes data cleaning, normalization, and augmentation techniques.

2. **Supervised Learning**: This notebook contains three different models for pet classification using supervised learning techniques. The models' performance is evaluated using appropriate metrics.

3. **Unsupervised Learning**: This notebook explores unsupervised learning techniques for pet classification. It includes clustering techniques and their evaluation.

4. **State-of-the-Art Models**: This notebook contains the implementation and comparison of two state-of-the-art models for pet classification. Transfer learning is used to leverage pre-trained models for our specific task.

## Installation and Usage

Clone the repository and install the necessary packages.You can run each notebook individually. Make sure to run the Data Preprocessing notebook before running the other notebooks as they depend on the preprocessed data.

## Results

The results of each experiment, including the model's performance metrics, are documented in their respective notebooks.
